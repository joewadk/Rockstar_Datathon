Hello! This was our team's submission for the 2024 Break Through Tech x Rockstar Games Datathon. Through the 4 hour session, we were able to uncover various amounts of insights over a given data set regarding player statistics. This project was worked on by Jawad Kabir, Simona Isakova, Samin Chowdhury, and Shreya Narayannan.

# About the Data
### Overview

Our team set out to analyze three distinct datasets related to GTA V player behavior: `player_statistics`, `item_spend`, and `player_activity`. The objective was to uncover user-behavior patterns, specifically exploring whether spending real money in GTA V improves game performance. We examined various metrics, including `ltd_days_played`, `money_earned`, `pvc_balance`, `rp_earned`, and `evc_balance`.

### Key Insights

1. **Money Spent vs. Game Performance:**
   - A plot graph analyzing the relationship between `evc_balance` and the kill-to-death (K/D) ratio revealed a surprising trend. Players who spent more money in the game generally had a worse K/D ratio. This suggests that players who struggle in the game might spend more money in an attempt to improve their performance, but this spending does not necessarily lead to better results.

2. **Pay-to-Play Influence:**
   - Our findings indicate that GTA V does not exhibit a pay-to-play model, as there was no correlation between money spent and improved K/D ratios. This reinforces the idea that spending money in the game does not guarantee better performance.

3. **Performance Metrics by Platform:**
   - **K/D Ratio:** The platform with the highest K/D ratio was XBOX, followed by PC, and then PS4.
   - **Time Spent:** PS4 players spent the most time on average per day, followed by XBOX and then PC.
   - **Total Money Spent:** PC players spent the most money, followed by XBOX, with PS4 players spending the least.

4. **Character Rank vs. K/D Ratio:**
   - Analysis of the character rank versus K/D ratio showed that there isn't a direct correlation. Interestingly, players with ranks between 100-200 had significantly higher K/D ratios compared to those ranked 200 and above, with the rank cap being 500.

5. **Top Players:**
   - The top 10 players, all on XBOX, started playing GTA V between 3-5 months after the onset of COVID-19.

# Conclusion

The data analysis provides compelling insights into player behavior in GTA V, particularly debunking the notion that spending more money leads to better performance. Additionally, platform-specific differences highlight how player engagement and spending vary across XBOX, PS4, and PC. The relationship between rank and K/D ratio also suggests that skill development may plateau or decline at higher ranks, which could be an area for further investigation.
